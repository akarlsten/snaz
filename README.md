# Snaz

A dark VS Code theme based on my previous theme [Snazzy Plus](https://github.com/akarlsten/snazzy-plus), which was in turn based on a few others.

The basic palette is the same but has been changed around somewhat, also added is a new darker color for UI elements outside the editor.

Additionally there is now theming for the entire UI thanks to the linting and compiling tools created (?) by the [Dracula VSCode](<(https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code)>) team.

Feel free to open a Github issue for any comments/suggestions.

**Now comes with a custom icon theme, based on a mix of icons from (VSCode Great Icons)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons] and (Material Icon Theme)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme], as well as a few originals.**
